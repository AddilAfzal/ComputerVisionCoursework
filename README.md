# Computer Vision Coursework

This repository contains code produced for my Compter Vision coursework.

Given a dataset consisting of images and videos of students taking the course, the aim of the project was to implement at least two different methods for facial recognition.

The methods of classification attempted are:

* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch

* Support Vector Machine (SVM) using OpenCV

* K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) using OpenCV

The final solution would take an input image, a classifier name and feature extraction type (SURF or HOG) and return a matrix consisting of predicted labels and positions of detected faces.

An additional task was to evaluate facial expressions and assign one of four labels, returned as the fourth value in the matrix. This was attempted using methods such as SVM and CNN.
